# Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning 🎮🤖
**Decision Making Algorithms Seminar Project - TUM**

This project presents a complete implementation and analysis of the groundbreaking 2013 DeepMind paper ["Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning"](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf) by Mnih et al., developed as part of our seminar on Decision Making Algorithms.

The Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm revolutionized reinforcement learning by successfully combining deep neural networks with Q-learning, achieving super human-level performance on multiple Atari 2600 games using only raw pixel inputs and game scores.

## 📖 About the Paper

The original DQN paper introduced several key innovations that made deep reinforcement learning feasible:

* **Experience Replay**: Storing and randomly sampling past experiences to break temporal correlations and improve data efficiency
* **End-to-End Learning**: Learning directly from raw pixels to actions without manual feature engineering
* **Human-Level Performance**: First algorithm to achieve human-level control on a wide variety of Atari games

Our implementation faithfully reproduces the architecture and training methodology described in the original paper, providing both educational insights and practical demonstrations of the algorithm's capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Highlights

* **Faithful Implementation**: Complete reproduction of the original DQN architecture and training methodology
* **Multiple Game Support**: Trained and tested on classic Atari games including Pong, Breakout, and Boxing
* **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Extensive testing framework with performance benchmarks and statistical analysis
* **Interactive Demos**: Real-time gameplay visualization with Q-value analysis
* **Educational Tools**: Step-by-step training process with detailed logging and visualization

## 🧠 How DQN Works

The DQN algorithm operates through three main components:

### 1. Neural Network Architecture 🏗️
* **Convolutional Layers**: Three conv layers (32, 64, 64 filters) for feature extraction from raw pixels
* **Fully Connected Layers**: Two dense layers (512 hidden units) for action-value estimation
* **Input Processing**: 84x84x4 grayscale frames (4 frames stacked for temporal information)

### 2. Training Process 🔄
* **Experience Replay**: Store transitions in replay buffer, sample random minibatches for training
* **Target Network**: Separate target network updated every 10,000 steps for stable Q-value targets
* **Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**: Gradually decay exploration from 100% to 1% over 1M steps

### 3. Environment Preprocessing 🔧
* **Frame Stacking**: Stack 4 consecutive frames to capture motion
* **Grayscale Conversion**: Convert RGB to grayscale for computational efficiency
* **Frame Skipping**: Repeat actions for 4 frames to reduce computational requirements
* **Reward Clipping**: Clip rewards to [-1, +1] for algorithm stability

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Original Architecture**: Exact replication of the 2013 DQN network architecture
* **Advanced Training**: Implementation with experience replay, target networks, and epsilon-greedy exploration
* **Multi-Game Support**: Pong, Breakout, Boxing environments with specialized preprocessing
* **Comprehensive Testing**: Evaluation framework with statistical analysis and video recording
* **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time Q-value display and gameplay analysis
* **Model Persistence**: Save and load trained models for evaluation and further training

## 💻 Technology Stack

* **Deep Learning**: PyTorch 2.5.1 for neural network implementation
* **Environment**: Gymnasium with Atari environments (ALE)
* **Preprocessing**: OpenCV for image processing and frame manipulation
* **Visualization**: Matplotlib for training plots and Q-value analysis
* **Development**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive development and analysis

## 📊 Results

Our DQN implementation successfully demonstrates the key findings from the original paper:

| Game | Original Paper Score | Our Implementation | Human Performance |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Pong | 18.9 | ~15-20 | 14.6 |
| Breakout | 317.8 | ~250-350 | 30.5 |
| Boxing | 71.8 | ~60-80 | 12.1 |

The agent learns effective strategies including ball tracking in Pong, brick-breaking patterns in Breakout, and defensive/offensive moves in Boxing.
